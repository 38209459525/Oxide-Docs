# Incognito
Access the world wide web! Incognito is a dynamic web proxy service stylized as a search engine.

## Setup

<!-- 
    Yes, I am linking to the github repo instead of pasting them here.
    The thing with doing that is if they change, I will have to make another PR with those changes.
    (and yes you can use HTML comments in md)

:::note

If you are looking to deploy to cloud hosting services please check the [README](https://github.com/amethystnetwork-dev/Incognito#readme) for the deploy buttons.

For hosting services that have a very limited storage space you can use [Incognito-Lite](https://github.com/amethystnetwork-dev/Incognito-Lite)

:::

As there is no official way to run Incognito, we will be using the deployable verison by Amethyst Network. You will need: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

First, clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amethystnetwork-dev/Incognito.git
```

To install the required packages, you will need to cd into the repository you just cloned and then run `npm install`. The commands can be seen below:
```sh
cd Incognito
npm install
```

To start Incognito, run the command below:
```sh
npm start
```

This starts the bare server and serves the static files on port 8080 by default.

## Config
To change the HTTP server port set the environment variable variable `PORT`.

### SSL Config
To enable SSL place your certificates in the SSL folder.

The certificate should be named `cert.pem` and the private key named `key.pem`.

When SSL is enabled port 443 will be used instead of 8080.

## Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet's bare server by default is set to `/bare/` by default. If you would like to use a different bare server, change it in `static/uv/uv.config.js`.

## Games
All games are not included by default due to the extremely large size of them and some hosting services having limited storage space.
