`https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?type=git&repository=github.com/[GITHUB USERNAME]/website-aio&branch=master&name=website-aio`

We encourage you to fork this repository before attempting to deploy to any of the services we recommend. This is because this repository explicitly violates the TOS of most services.

How to deploy your forked repository:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/holy-unblocker/website-aio/fork).
2. Go to any deployment page in [the wiki](https://github.com/holy-unblocker/website-aio/wiki).
3. Replace `[GITHUB USERNAME]` with your GitHub username.

Example:

> ### Manual Link
>
> `https://heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/[GITHUB USERNAME]/website-aio`

I fork this repository under my account. The link is https://github.com/e9x/website-aio.

I replace `[GITHUB USERNAME]` in the link from [Manual Link](#manual-link) with my account name (e9x). My link is now `https://heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/e9x/website-aio`.

If you forked this repository under a name other than website-aio, replace `website-aio` in the link with your fork's name.

## Known Incompatible Services

### Static Hosting

Many static website solutions will compile websites using a dedicated container/VM, however they will run into errors such as not being able to find the public directory because this repository is configured to serve the static files in conjunction with proxies and databases.

#### Update
I have ended over ownership of Holy Unblocker to be maintained further to Eli. All current versions have been developed by Divide.

#### Important Message (Original)
This isn’t the greatest announcement sorry. After lots of thought and severe hesitation I’m shutting down Holy Unblocker and leaving TN. It's just been something that I’ve been super conflicted with for months hence the lack of updates and the massive gaps that happened last year. I just didn’t want to throw away a project that I passionately enjoyed and spent time on while making amazing friends and meeting epic devs here. I could go on forever for who these people are but ima like leave it here. They know who they are :D

The main change of thought is that I’m finally just putting an end right now due to 1) the lack of motivation 2) the community is NOT the greatest at time and not the nicest at times (have to put that out here) 3) the future doesn’t look so good for HU/TN as a project.

Some things I’ll be keeping secret since there are more reasons to this choice unless otherwise for those who don’t find this enough information. Good friends here will know that I’ve been super stressed about this choice for months now. Also regardless a good motivator for this choice is the fact that I’ll be graduating soon.

It’s possible that I may continue/come back for this in the future or keep it on GitHub only. I leave this here because even now I am still doubting myself about this change. But for now I’d check out other proxy sites like Incognito (Duce DOES a ton of updates frequently and he is the creator/developer of Ultraviolet so give him some love) :yayy_hopi: 

Check out his Patreon also! For current HU patrons you will not be billed next month and the HU Patreon will be archived so head over to Duce’s patron so he can purchase more domains for Incognito.

With love <3
