These are three methods for bypassing family link if your school or workplace puts it on there.

# Method 1:

:::note
Requirements: Android 5.0 or higher, adding new accounts unrestricted.
:::

1. Go to the device's "Settings" app. Find and tap on "Users & Accounts"/"Multiple Users"
2. Tap on "Add user." Select "Set up now" to create a new account.
3. Follow the prompts to set up the new account. DO NOT ENABLE LOCATION SERVICES OR IT WILL HANG. I personally would not connect to WiFi until the account is made. Once the account is set up, the new user can log in and do whatever they want, as it is totally separate from the old user. 
4. There should be no family link restrictions at all. Make sure not to add your old account in any way except through Firefox or a non-google browser (which I still wouldn't recommend). Doing stuff on your old account frequently is recommended as not to raise suspicion from whoever put Family Link on your device, whether it be your school, work, or whoever.

# Method 2: Samsung Method (found and written by hazel), recommended for samsung based

1. To enable "Secure Folders"Â ```Open settings > Security And Privacy > Secure Folder```
2. Go through the setup
3. lock type > *setup a password or somthin* 
4. Different Exploits:Getting an unblocked account on there:

```Secure Folder Settings > Manage Accounts > Google > *sign-in to a different google account*```

Unblocking all apps:```Secure Folder App > Plus Icon > Download from Play Store```

Unlimited Screen time (Not tested, idk if it works):```Secure Folder App > Plus Icon > Add App > Open App```

# Method 3
:::note
This is not reccomended at all. It will notify your parents and lock your phone for a day.
:::

1. Ensure you are over 13
2. "Manage my account" with your google account, scroll down, and disable family link.
