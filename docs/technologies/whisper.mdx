# Whisper
Wisp protocol client that exposes the Wisp connection over a TUN device.

## When is this useful?
Many instutions are employing [NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-next-generation-firewall-ngfw/) technlogy that can identify and block encrypted VPN traffic through the use of DPI (deep packet inspection).
To circumvent this, Whisper can be used to create a TUN device that routes all internet traffic through a select Wisp server. All traffic will be undifferentiable from typical WebSocket traffic.

## Whisper usage examples

### Linux
`whisper --tun tun0 --url wss://nebulaproxy.io/wisp/`
### Windows
`whisper.exe --tun tun0 --url wss://nebulaproxy.io/wisp/`
