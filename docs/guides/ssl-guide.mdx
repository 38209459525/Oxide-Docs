## Getting Started

For this tutorial Certbot will be used. Other open source clients which utilize **Let's Encrypt** as well however.

> Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.

Certbot is an interface with Let's Encrypt service, a CLI tool that can be used to generate and renew your certificates. With this example Canonical Ubuntu 20.04 will be used.

First you will want to run essential commands:

```
sudo apt update && upgrade
sudo apt install certbot
```

You can also look into installing either `python3-certbot-apache` or `python3-certbot-nginx` as well for automatic usage. The status of these plugins can be viewed using the command below:

```
certbot plugins
```

## CLI Usage

Standalone mode will be the priority for this tutorial.

`--manual`: Specifies whether or not plugins will be used to make this automatic

`--preferred-challenges`: Can either be DNS or HTTP. DNS is the preferred option as for verification you will resort to adding a TXT record to your zone.

`--d`: Specifies the domain that will be used for renewal

```
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d \*.example.com
```

Note how the domain is wildcarded. This is particularly important for users who wish to maintain an active proxy service with many domains/subdomains.
