:::note
This relies on you being below version 129. See [ChromeOS Versioning](/kajigs/crosver).
:::

1. Create or log into a proton VPN account

https://account.protonvpn.com/signup

2. Once you have an account go to - account > OpenVPN / IKEv2 username
3. Copy the username and password
4. Unzip the files and choose any server that you want to use (like us-19 or s/t)
5. Edit it in the Text editor app (it's a built-in chrome app on Chromebook) or any other text editor
6. All the way at the end, after "TLSAuthContents": "-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1----- put in

```
   ,
          "Username": "(Put your username here)",
          "Password": "(Put your password here)"
```

You can just copy and paste it and you'll get the right formatting.

Make sure that you start the paste right after the end quotation mark.

- Save the onc file
- Upload it to `chrome://network#general` all the way at the bottom where it says Import ONC File (don't worry if you don't notice anything, just try scrolling down a little more and it should say `Networks imported: 1` (regardless of how many you actualy imported)
