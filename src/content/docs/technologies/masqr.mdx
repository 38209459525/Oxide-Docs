# MASQR

## What is MASQR?

Think of Masqr as a "anti link leaking" authentication system that allows you to use your proxy bot domain only on one device to prevent filters from grabbing on and to help developers not spend so much money on buying hundereds of domains just for them to be blocked because of link leakers.

## How can I deploy this?

This is fairly easy to deploy to your backend using `express` as seen in the [https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/MasqrProject/blob/master/MasqrBackend/index.js](`MasqrBackend` example), and you can implement this into different backends fairly similarly.
You can also use [https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/masqr-middleware](masqr-middleware) if you'd like to avoid implementing masqr yourself.

To set this up you'll want to create a few files, in addition to adding this to your app.
Those files include 
- Checkfailed.html - this will be your fallback failure page
- placeholder.svg, a default image for v0.dev sites

Optionally, place a folder named `Masqrd` in your server directory
Inside `Masqrd`, an individual masqd page for when domain fails for EACH domain
for example, if anura.christmas fails to validate, it will serve `./Masqrd/anura.christma.html.`

## How it works

How masqr works is really simple. When you get a link from a proxy bot of some sorts (for demonstration purposes I will be referencing Titanium Networks Proxy Bot) and you will be told to click on a link with some strange characters that will create a cookie which is "your license" then when you visit the site afterwards, it will check the cookie with the one in the licensing server's database to make sure it wasn't tampered with then your in!
