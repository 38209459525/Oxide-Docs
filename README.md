# Oxide-Docs

The official SDK documentation site for TitaniumNetwork. Here we provide advanced web proxy services through the progression of web proxy technologies.
This composes from advanced URL rewriting proxies, webOS projects, web-based emulation built from libretro, kajigs (a repository of device/OS exploits) and also web browser experimentations with service-workers. As a result a wide variety of sites are supported, speed is prioritized and resource consumption has also been significantly optimized compared to previous technologies.
